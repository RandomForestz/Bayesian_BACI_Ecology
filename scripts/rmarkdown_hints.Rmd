# What this file shows

This R Markdown document is a practical reference for:

- **Header sizes** using `#`, `##`, `###`, etc.
- **Tabsets** (tabs in HTML output)
- **Code folding** (hide/show code chunks)
- **Themes** (Bootstrap themes for HTML)

> Note: Tabsets + themes are primarily an **HTML feature**. If you knit to PDF/Word, tabsets won’t behave like tabs.

# Header sizes with `#`

Headers control both **visual size** *and* the **document outline** (Table of Contents).

# Level 1 header (`#`)
Use for major sections.

## Level 2 header (`##`)
Use for subsections.

### Level 3 header (`###`)
Use for sub-subsections.

#### Level 4 header (`####`)
Use sparingly; TOC depth often stops before this.

Tip: Your YAML controls TOC depth:
- `toc_depth: 2` shows down to `##`
- `toc_depth: 3` shows down to `###`

# Tabsets (HTML tabs)

Tabsets let you create tabs using headings. You enable a tabset by adding the attribute:

`{.tabset}`

## Tabset example {.tabset}

### Overview
This is the first tab’s content.

### Details
This is the second tab’s content.

### Notes
This is the third tab’s content.

### Code example
You can include code chunks inside a tab too:

```{r}
summary(mtcars$mpg)
```


Nested tabsets (allowed, but don’t overdo it) {.tabset}
Outer tab A

Content in outer tab A.

Outer tab B
Inner tabset {.tabset}
Inner tab 1

Inner tab 1 content.

Inner tab 2

Inner tab 2 content.

Code folding

Code folding adds a small toggle so people can hide/show your R code in the rendered HTML.

Turn on folding for the whole document (YAML)

In the YAML header:

code_folding: hide → code chunks start collapsed

code_folding: show → code chunks start expanded

Example (already set in this document):

output:
  html_document:
    code_folding: hide
Control visibility per chunk

You can still control what appears using chunk options:

echo = TRUE/FALSE → show/hide code

include = TRUE/FALSE → include chunk output in the document or not

eval = TRUE/FALSE → run code or not

Show code and output
mean(mtcars$mpg)
Hide code, show output (echo=FALSE)
mean(mtcars$mpg)
Show code, hide output (results='hide')
mean(mtcars$mpg)
Hide everything but still run (include=FALSE)
x <- rnorm(1000)
Themes (HTML)

Themes control the overall look: fonts, colors, spacing, tables, and heading styles.

In R Markdown HTML output, theme: uses Bootstrap themes (via rmarkdown).

Setting a theme

In YAML:

output:
  html_document:
    theme: flatly

You can also set theme: null if you want to supply your own CSS.

Common built-in themes you can use

You can usually use these theme names directly:

default

cerulean

journal

flatly

readable

spacelab

united

cosmo

lumen

paper

sandstone

simplex

yeti

Example switch:

output:
  html_document:
    theme: yeti
When to use CSS instead (or in addition)

If you want more control than a theme provides (e.g., custom fonts, tighter margins, branded colors), add a CSS file:

output:
  html_document:
    theme: flatly
    css: "styles.css"

And then create styles.css in the same folder.

Mini example: everything together
Report section {.tabset}
Plot
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
Table
head(mtcars)
Model (code hidden)
fit <- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, data = mtcars)
summary(fit)

If you want, I can also give you:
- a version that is **Quarto (.qmd)** instead of Rmd, or
- an Rmd that includes a **custom CSS starter** (clean “Headwaters-ish” dark or light).
